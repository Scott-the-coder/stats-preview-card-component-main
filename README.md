## My process

I started with the desktop version of the site to get my base information set up, by adding all divs and font formatting, along with color scheme.
Using flexboxes i positioned all of my content within the divs I allocated to give the appearance of a centralised stats card.

I then used media query to alter my design depending on whether the users screen is more or less than 500px.

once i had this in place I added the surrounding code to hide the opposing image and create padding and margins around and within divs.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Flexbox
- Media Query

### What I learned

My main leaarning curve was media query to which I used MDN to learn the process required to alter the content depending on different aspects of device, particularly the width on this occassion.
I also learned more about flexboxes and how to justify content and align content in other ways.

@media (min-width: 501px){
  .mobile{
    display: none;
  }
  .text-container{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-around;
    align-content: space-around;
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    margin: 4em;
    text-align: left;
    }
  .desktop, .overlay{
    border-radius: 0 10px 10px 0;
  }
  .stat-container{
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    justify-content: space-between;
    padding-right: 4em;
  }
  .heading, .paragraph{
    margin: 0 0 2em 0;
  }
  .desktop{
    height: 100%;
  }
}

### Continued development

I am to carry on learning about media query and the various parameters it can work to other then the screen sizing.
my positioning is getting better but i also aim to keep working on this to perfect it.
